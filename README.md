This is a rich client scala play application to show easyly human consumable information form RDF graphs.

## Getting started

For development purposes, install the [typesafe acitvator](https://www.typesafe.com/get-started).
We are also using node js and npm to run bower for your javascript library dependency management. 
So ensure, that [npm / nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) is in the path of your plattform before running **activator run** in the root folder of our application.

## Deployment

- create a zip file using the **sbt dist** goal, which contains all library dependencies and also the embedded netty webserver which is advised when deploying play projects
- extract the zip on your server where you like
- adjust config parameters in application.conf (e.g. http.port which is the application listening on for http requests), 
  **important:** Adjust lucene search suggestions settings: 
  Don't forget the change the filepath property "ldb.dbpedia_indexdir", if you already got the index present on the server (got it as a zip).
  When creating the index from screch, ensure that the "ldb.dbpedia_surfaceforms" points to a valid "surface_forms.ttl" file and the indexdir points to a existing directory
- start the application with the scripts, which are located in the bin subdirectory of the deployment zip, according to the platform you running on
